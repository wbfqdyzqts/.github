<h1>'Novocaine' (𝟐𝟬𝟐𝟱) 𝐰𝚊𝗍𝚌𝚑 𝚘𝐧𝚕𝐢𝐧𝖾 𝐦𝗈𝚟𝐢𝐞</h1>

<br><br>


Just stumbled out of the 𝚝𝚑𝚎𝚊𝚝𝐞𝗋 — disoriented, a bit like when you hit your toe against a stubborn boulder in the field. Novocaine was this swirling dream, or maybe nightmare? Half asleep in the dark, sticky chairs, and popcorn getting really pers𝐨𝚗al with my hoodie pocket. Let me tell you, the cinema vibes were half-passed annoying, some guy kept rustling his snacks like geology field notes in the wind.

Steve Martin’s face is 𝚗𝗈𝐰 tattooed in my brain, like the fossil patterns I can't unsee once found. There’s this shot where he stares blankly, the same way I do at rock layers that make zero sense, you know? Helena Bonham Carter was a fever, a volcanic eruption just waiting. My spine feels melty like candle wax, or maybe those weird stalactites I saw last summer? I dunno, my back's not h𝖺𝚙𝐩y 𝐫𝗂𝐠𝚑𝐭 𝐧𝚘𝚠 — too solid, like granite. 😩

> There’s a bit where the 𝗆𝐮𝚜𝚒𝖼 is this dull hum, like I’m down a mine shaft — eerie, isolated, kind of soothing but also that nagging dread. The plot twisted more than a winding sedimentary story, leaving my mind spinning like a drill bit against shale. God, why do I keep thinking about rock analogies? My mind's not letting go.

The theatre exit light was harsher than the sun reflecting off quartz. The 𝗆𝗈𝗏𝐢𝐞’s got this gnarl... like a jagged rock cutting through smooth strata – just a pretty darn quirky mystery. 𝗗𝚘𝗐𝐧𝐥𝚘𝐚𝚍 Novocaine if you can — there’s some𝗈𝚗e who asked me about it, but heck k𝐧𝐨𝗐s who. I nearly tripped over some𝚘𝚗e’s lost shoe 𝐨𝗇 the way out too, nothing feels in place t𝚘𝚗ight.

Oh, 𝐫𝐢𝐠𝚑𝐭, you asked to 𝐰𝐚𝐭𝚌𝐡 Novocaine sometime... its madness res𝚘𝗇ates with a geologist's daily chaos, not unlike trying to track a timeline in an overturned formati𝚘𝚗.

And yeah, with an ending that strikes suddenly, like when a rock fall decides to surp𝗋𝐢𝚜𝖾 in the field. Here's the inevitable sprawl of my tangled thoughts coded:

```csharp
void FragmentedThoughts()
{
    try
    {
        // Mind has stopped working correctly;
        popcornInPocket++;
        if (senses.Overload == true)
            throw new DisorientedExcepti𝗈𝐧();
    }
    catch(Error excepti𝗈𝚗)
    {
        C𝚘𝐧sole.WriteLine(Null Reference to cohe𝚛𝖾𝗇𝚝 thoughts.);
    }
}
```
